# ClimateDataJam

Before you hop into this project, please take a moment to read this thread from the 2024 Critical Code Studies Working Group:

- [Unpacking Climate Code: Data Rhetoric, Magic Cards, and the SSPs](https://wg.criticalcodestudies.com/index.php?p=/discussion/177/code-critique-unpacking-climate-code-data-rhetoric-magic-cards-and-the-ssps)

This should give you a better idea of the goals, scope and context of this project.

By now, you should have read the CCSWG working group thread [CCSWG working group thread](https://wg.criticalcodestudies.com/index.php?p=/discussion/177/code-critique-unpacking-climate-code-data-rhetoric-magic-cards-and-the-ssps), which should give you a sense of why the broken "population" metric needs to be removed from the SSPs and other forms of climate data and ecological data. If you have not yet read that thread, please take time to read it.

# Three Proposed "Social Driver" Metrics for this Alternative Form of Climate Scenarios Modeling:
- Fossil Fuel Funding (fff) - divided into global investment ($investment) and global subsidies ($subsidies)
- Localization 
- DDEI

# Here are some ideas for what could happen next:
- Develop metrics to show relation between fossil fuel funding ($investment, $subsidies) and increased global CO2 emissions (gigatonnes, GtCO2).
- Create new set of socio-economic scenarios data that exclube the broken populaton metric.
-  This set of scearios data would use fff (fossil fuel funding) as its core social driver (simular to the way the SSPs use "population"). FFF would be mediated in two ways: $investment and $subsidies.
-   While the SSPs use "urbanization" and "GPD," these metrics are also contentious, and should be left out of this be scenarios approach.
-   As altneratives to "urbanization" and "GDP," we might consider two alternative metrics: "Localization" and "DDEI."
-   "Localization" measures how far goods and food travel to reach people, as well as the degree to which production and land use is controlled by people local to a region, including Indigenous sovereignty.  
-   "DDEI" stands for "democratization, diversity, equity, and inclusioin." It meausures things like democratic control over politics, co-ops (democratic control of workplaces and housing), gender equity, anti-racism, representation in the media of differing groups, etc.
-   Work needs to be done to assemble an updated bibliography laying out the studies that support the use of these three alerative metrics.

# Considerations
- While the SSPs tend to congeal their social metrics together before running them through the models, perhaps our approach could include ways to parse out different metrics and easily toggle the metrics up and down? This may help users better understand the cause and effects.
- For each of the metrics, it will be important ot include ordinary language walk-throughs that explain how these "social structures" lead to emissions, making it easy for non-experts to understand.
- While developing these data sets and metrics, it's worth thinking through different types of tools in which they might be incorporated.
- Likewise it is worth documenting any constructive criticisms we may have about methods. While this approach is intended as an intervention into the SSPs, perhaps there are better ways of doing this? 
   
# Workflow Notes

Harlin/Hayley: I have a bunch of data I can plug into this to support treating linking these three metrics to changes in emissions, but I've run out of time to work on this project. I'm hoping to have more time in the summer... but also don't have support and want to stay feed while working on this, ha ha. Any and all ideas for ways to support this work would be appricated.
