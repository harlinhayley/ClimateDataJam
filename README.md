# ClimateDataJam
What if there was a better way of approaching future-oriented climate data? Check out my post in the 2024 CCSWG to get a sense of this project:

[Unpacking Climate Code: Data Rhetoric, Magic Cards, and the SSPs](https://wg.criticalcodestudies.com/index.php?p=/discussion/177/code-critique-unpacking-climate-code-data-rhetoric-magic-cards-and-the-ssps)

Is there a better way to parameterize future-oriented climate data? Specifically data that attempts to track how human actions will impact future emissions? Let's play around with ideas here! 

I've got an idea of how to do it, but maybe you have a better one? Let's jam and see what we come up with :)

What if we have three types of social metrics tried to emissions:
1) Investment/Subsidies towards expanding directly emitting infrastructure
2) Democratization & DEI
3) Localization (i.e., distence goods and food must travel to get to people)

I'm hoping to have time to lay this all out in more detail soon, perhaps over Spring or Summer Break.
