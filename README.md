## **The Social Structure Drivers (SSDs): Towards a new approach to climate and ecological projections**

## Two goals of this project
- Offer a more ethical and accurate approach to projecting the impact of human behavior upon climate and ecology. 
- Develop an approach that does not use the broken "population" "GDP" and "urbanization" metrics that can be found in current leading approaches that have been shown to be inaccurate and unethical.

## The SSDs: Three Proposed Alternative Metrics for Climate Scenarios Modeling:
- **Fossil Fuel Funding (fff)** - divided into global investment ($investment) and global subsidies ($subsidies).
- **Localization (L)** - how far goods and food travel to reach people (L-distance), localization of money and exchange (L-exchange), the degree to which production and land use is controlled by people local to a region including Indigenous sovereignty (L-landuse), etc. 
- **Equity (E)** - This gets into the emissions reductions correlated with things like democratic control over politics (E-pol), democratic control of workplaces + housing + production (E-coops), gender equity (E-gender), anti-racism and reduction of inter-group inequity (E-intergroup), improved inclusion of people under 25 on decision-making boards (E-age), etc.

These three alternative social drivers (fff, L, & E) would replace "population" "GDP" and "urbanization" in climate scenarios data. 

# Ideas for what could happen next:
- Develop metric to show relation between fff ($investment, $subsidies) and increased global CO2 emissions (gigatonnes, GtCO2), as well as other pollutants. Repairative data work and counterdata is needed to fill data gaps.
- Develop metric to show relation between L (L-distance, L-exchange, L-landuse) and increased global CO2 emissions (gigatonnes, GtCO2),  as well as other pollutants. Repairative data work and counterdata is needed to fill data gaps.
- Develop metric to show relation between fff ($investment, $subsidies) and increased global CO2 emissions (gigatonnes, GtCO2), as well as other pollutants. Repairative data work and counterdata is needed to fill data gaps.
- Work needs to be done to assemble an updated bibliography that pertain to these new metrics, and a rationale written for their use.

# More about fff, L & E
-  This set of scenarios data would use fff (fossil fuel funding) as its core social driver (similar to the way the SSPs and other prior models use "population"). FFF would include the two subcatagories: $investment and $subsidies. This is a _fixed catagory_, and would only include these two factors. 
-  L (Localization) measures the degree to which various social-structures have been localized in ways that have been found to corelate with emissions reductions. This is an _expanding catagory_, and might be modified to include new factors that are established as these datasets expand. 
-   E (Equity) meausures forms of democratization, including co-ops (democratic control of workplaces, housing, and production), improved gender equity, anti-racism & the reduction of intergroup inequities, equities in representation in the media of differing groups, etc. This is an _expanding catagory_, and might be modified to include new factors that are established as these datasets expand. 

## Considerations
- While prior approaches (such as the SSPs) tend to congeal the social metrics together before running them through the models, perhaps a new, better approach could make it easier to parse out different metrics and allow users to more easily to toggle the metrics up and down themselves? This may help users better understand the projected cause and effect.
- For each of the metrics, it will be important to offer walk-throughs that explain how these "social structures" lead to emissions, making it easy for non-experts to understand why these metrics were chosen. Thorough and appropriate meta-data is a must!
- While developing these data sets and metrics, it will be important to keep in mind different types of tools in which they might be incorporated. In this way, working with game designers is advised, so we might ensure these data are as usable as possible for those who wish to create games and interactive tools.
- It is worth considering that every metric that can be toggled up or down is a form of "game mechanic rhetoric" that encourages uses to behave in ways that cause that thing to change. In this regard, ethical considerations must be taken regarding which metrics are rendered interactive in any climate data or tool.
- It is worth documenting any constructive criticisms we may have about methods, especially present climate data modeling regimes. While one of our goals is to offer an intervention into prior methods, is the type of modeling really the best approach? An intervention of this kind is certainly needed, but might there be a new paradigm that comes into focus while we work? (But even then...unless we intervene thoroughly in prior approaches, they will continue to be used to incentivize the misdirection of funds, labor, and attention towards non-solutions).
