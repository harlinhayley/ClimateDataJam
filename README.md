# ClimateDataJam
What if there was a better way of approaching future-oriented climate data? Check out my post in the 2024 CCSWG to get a sense of this project [ link forthcoming].
Do you have an idea for a better way to parameterize future-oriented climate data? Specifically data that attempts to track how human actions will impact future emissions? Feel free to add your suggestions to this repository!
